	 * Make custom hit boxes
	 *
	 * Have the avatar have a wide hit box on the bottom and a thin hit box on
	 * the bottom
	 * 
	 * Ensure that the app doesnt run after close. This is probably happening
	 * because threads are still running upon close.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * IDEA FOR ANOTHER GAME Like minecraft, but 2d. Like terraria or house of
	 * wolves. You can build stuff with blocks. Press a button to open up a HUD,
	 * like LBP's popit, where you select blocks. Then you can place them around
	 * you, by selecting the direction with the arrow key. Doors, tools,
	 * background (walls), light sources (mess with opacity/brightness)
